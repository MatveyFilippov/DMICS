# Examples:
#### You can run any examples from lefebvre's book or created by myself
> For example, if you run [10_1_4.json](ExampleData/from_lefebvre_book/direct_task/10_1_4.json), you can make sure that the result corresponds to the answer given on the picture `10.1.4` in the theoretical textbook

All config (.json) files are placed in [/ExampleData/](ExampleData)
> [/ExampleData/from_lefebre_book/](ExampleData/from_lefebvre_book) all files are named by picture in textbook
> [/ExampleData/created/](ExampleData/created)
